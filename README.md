From Signs to Speech â€“ Real-Time ASL Recognition âœ‹ðŸ¤Ÿ

Iâ€™m thrilled to share one of my most exciting projects yet!

I built a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system that:

Detects hand gestures for ASL letters through a webcam.

Builds complete words as you sign.

Speaks them out loud instantly using Text-to-Speech.


Why?
Because technology should break barriers â€“ helping the deaf and mute community communicate more easily with everyone.

Tech stack:

Mediapipe â€“ Hand landmark detection

Random Forest Classifier â€“ Letter recognition

OpenCV â€“ Video processing & visualization

pyttsx3 â€“ Text-to-Speech
